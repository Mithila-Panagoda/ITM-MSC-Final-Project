# Pull Request: Frontend Role-Based Access Control and Donation Functionality Fixes

## 🎯 Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system for the frontend and fixes critical donation functionality issues. It also includes backend improvements to support automatic campaign amount updates and enhanced user authentication.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **New Component**: `RoleBasedRoute` for declarative route protection
- **Enhanced AuthContext**: Added role checking utilities (`hasRole`, `isCharityManager`)
- **Dynamic UI**: Hide/show buttons and navigation items based on user roles
- **Route Protection**: Restrict access to specific routes based on user permissions

### ✅ Donation Functionality Fixes
- **Fixed Redirection Issue**: "Donate Now" buttons now properly open donation dialogs
- **Enhanced Form Validation**: Added client-side validation with proper error handling
- **Success/Error Feedback**: Users get clear feedback on donation success/failure
- **Cache Invalidation**: Real-time updates across all views after donations

### ✅ Backend Improvements
- **Django Signals**: Automatic campaign `raised_amount` updates when donations are created/deleted
- **New API Endpoint**: `/users/me/` for current user authentication
- **Enhanced Serializers**: Default donation status set to `COMPLETED`
- **Role Support**: Full support for `CHARITY_MANAGER` role

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Donation Button Redirection Issue
- **Problem**: "Donate Now" buttons redirected to home page instead of opening donation dialog
- **Root Cause**: Non-existent route `/campaigns/:id/donate` in routing configuration
- **Solution**: Updated button to navigate to campaign detail page where donation dialog exists

### 2. Campaign Amount Not Updating
- **Problem**: Dashboard and charity card values not updating after donations
- **Root Cause**: No automatic recalculation of campaign `raised_amount`
- **Solution**: Implemented Django signals to automatically update amounts when donations change

### 3. User Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: `getCurrentUser()` API returning array instead of single user
- **Root Cause**: Using generic `/users/` endpoint instead of user-specific endpoint
- **Solution**: Created dedicated `/users/me/` endpoint for current user

### 4. Unauthorized UI Elements
- **Problem**: Regular users could see "Add Campaign" and "Add Charity" buttons
- **Root Cause**: No role-based UI visibility controls
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive RBAC system with conditional rendering

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Role-Based Access
1. **Login as CHARITY_MANAGER**:
   - ✅ Should see "Create Campaign" and "Add Charity" buttons
   - ✅ Should be redirected to campaigns page (not dashboard)
   - ✅ Should NOT see Tokens or Transactions in navigation

2. **Login as USER**:
   - ❌ Should NOT see "Create Campaign" or "Add Charity" buttons
   - ✅ Should see full navigation menu
   - ✅ Should be able to donate to campaigns

3. **Test Route Protection**:
   - Navigate to `/campaigns/new` as USER
   - ✅ Should see "Access Denied" message

### Test Donation Functionality
1. Go to any campaign detail page
2. Click "Donate Now" button
3. ✅ Should open donation dialog (not redirect)
4. Fill in amount and submit
5. ✅ Should show success message and close dialog
6. ✅ Dashboard and campaign amounts should update immediately

### Test API Integration
1. Check that all API calls work correctly
2. Verify pagination handling for different response formats
3. Test error handling and user feedback
